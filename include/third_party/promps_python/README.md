# PROMP library written in python

* Implementation of Probabilistic Movement Primitives in the [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-017-9648-7)

* Few of the utility functions are used from following [implementation](https://github.com/baxter-flowers/promplib).

* Includes the closed form implementation of trajectory controller implementation as well.

* Since one PROMP can only model one 1D, several of these has to be called to create a multi-dimensional PROMP


### Instructions

* Clone the repo

* From the cloned repo folder; run set_env_bash.sh

* Run the file demo_with_matlab_data.py from the demos folder (this uses a demonstration given in the data folder)
